# Data Protection Policy

> This page is also available in [German](./datenschutz).

## Introduction

This website is a documentation project for the `vitepress-plugin-codesandbox` plugin, which adds "Open in CodeSandbox" buttons to VitePress code blocks.

This documentation is built with [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev/) and is hosted on GitHub Pages.

As service providers, GitHub may collect certain technically necessary data *(including IP addresses)* in accordance with their privacy policy.

This website uses Umami for anonymous analytics. Umami is a privacy-friendly, cookie-less analytics solution that anonymizes all collected data and does not track users across websites.

## Analytics

We use Umami, a privacy-focused analytics tool, to collect anonymous usage statistics about our website. This helps us understand how users interact with our documentation and improve the user experience.

Umami does not use cookies and does not collect any personally identifiable information. All data is anonymized and we cannot identify individual users through this analytics tool.

The following anonymous data may be collected:
- Page views and referral sources
- Browser type and device information
- Country of origin (based on anonymized IP)
- Session duration and navigation paths

As Umami does not use cookies and does not collect personal data, consent for this type of analytics is not required under GDPR.

## No User Data Collection

This website is primarily an informational documentation site. Apart from the anonymized analytics described above, we do not:
- Require user registration or authentication for general use of the site
- Collect any personal information from visitors on our own servers
- Process or store any user-specific data beyond what is technically necessary for hosting
- Use cookies for tracking or personalization purposes

## Your Rights

Under the GDPR, you have various rights regarding the processing of your personal data. In the context of this documentation site, these rights are relevant in particular where third-party services such as Umami (analytics) or the hosting provider (GitHub Pages) process personal data.

For analytics data, you can manage settings directly in your browser. You may also contact us if you have questions regarding how these services are integrated into this site.

For any questions about our data practices, please contact us via email at [hello@textmode.art](mailto:hello@textmode.art).
